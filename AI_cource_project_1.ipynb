\\r\\n\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\r\\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\r\\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\r\\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\r\\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\r\\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\r\\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\r\\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\r\\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\r\\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\r\\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\r\\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\r\\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\r\\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\r\\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\r\\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\r\\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\r\\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\r\\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\r\\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\r\\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\r\\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\r\\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\r\\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\r\\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\r\\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\r\\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\r\\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\r\\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\r\\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\r\\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\r\\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\r\\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\\r\\n\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\r\\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\r\\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\r\\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\r\\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\r\\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\r\\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\r\\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\r\\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\r\\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\r\\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\r\\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\r\\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\r\\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\r\\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\r\\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\r\\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\r\\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\r\\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\r\\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\r\\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\r\\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\r\\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\r\\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\r\\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\r\\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\r\\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\r\\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\r\\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\r\\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\r\\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\r\\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\r\\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\\r\\n\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\r\\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\r\\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\r\\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\r\\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\r\\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\r\\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\r\\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\r\\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\r\\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\r\\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\r\\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\r\\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\r\\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\r\\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\r\\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\r\\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\r\\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\r\\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\r\\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\r\\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\r\\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\r\\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\r\\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\r\\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\r\\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\r\\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\r\\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\r\\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\r\\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\r\\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\r\\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\r\\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8491773392769579,\n        \"min\": -0.9996,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1044,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9138,\n          0.9814\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\r\\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever . \\r\\nit's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\r\\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s . \\r\\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \\\" under the sea \\\" and \\\" kiss the girl , \\\" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\r\\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\r\\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \\r\\n\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\r\\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\r\\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\r\\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\r\\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\r\\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\r\\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\r\\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\r\\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\r\\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\r\\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\r\\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\r\\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\r\\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\r\\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\r\\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\r\\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\r\\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\r\\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\r\\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\r\\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\r\\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\r\\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\r\\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\r\\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\r\\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\r\\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\r\\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\r\\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\r\\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\r\\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\r\\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\r\\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8491773392769579,\n        \"min\": -0.9996,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1044,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9138,\n          0.9814\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sid_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
